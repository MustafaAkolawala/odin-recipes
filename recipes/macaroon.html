    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      it's never a bad time for dessert. Cookies, cake, pie, you name it! But
      sometimes you need to change it up with something a little fancier: enter
      macaroons. They may seem intimidating but with our easy-to-follow guide,
      they don’t have to be. And you can customize them! Want a variety? Use
      different types of food coloring. Prefer a different flavored icing? Add
      some lavender extract for a floral feel. One bite, and you’ll feel like
      you’re in Paris yourself.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <h4>Macaroons</h4>
      <li>1 ¾ cups powdered sugar(210 g)</li>
      <li>1 cup almond flour(95 g), finely ground</li>
      <li>teaspoon salt, divided</li>
      <li>3 egg whites, at room temperature</li>
      <li>¼ cup granulated sugar(50 g)</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 drops pink gel food coloring</li>
      <h4>Vanilla buttercream</h4>
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter(230 g), 2 sticks, at room temperature</li>
      <li>3 cups powdered sugar(360 g)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the macaroons: In the bowl of a food processor, combine the
        powdered sugar, almond flour, and ½ teaspoon of salt, and process on low
        speed, until extra fine. Sift the almond flour mixture through a
        fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        in a separate large bowl, beat the egg whites and the remaining ½
        teaspoon of salt with an electric hand mixer until soft peaks form.
        Gradually add the granulated sugar until fully incorporated. Continue to
        beat until stiff peaks form (you should be able to turn the bowl upside
        down without anything falling out).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the vanilla and beat until incorporated. Add the food coloring and
        beat until just combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add about ⅓ of the sifted almond flour mixture at a time to the beaten
        egg whites and use a spatula to gently fold until combined. After the
        last addition of almond flour, continue to fold slowly until the batter
        falls into ribbons and you can make a figure 8 while holding the spatula
        up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the macaroon batter into a piping bag fitted with a round tip.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 4 dots of the batter in each corner of a rimmed baking sheet, and
        place a piece of parchment paper over it, using the batter to help
        adhere the parchment to the baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pipe the macaroons onto the parchment paper in 1½-inch (3-cm) circles,
        spacing at least 1-inch (2-cm) apart.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tap the baking sheet on a flat surface 5 times to release any air
        bubbles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the macaroons sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour,
        until dry to the touch.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 300˚F (150˚C).</li>
      <li>
        Bake the macaroons for 17 minutes, until the feet are well-risen and the
        macaroons don’t stick to the parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the macaroons to a wire rack to cool completely before filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the buttercream: In a large bowl, add the butter and beat with a
        mixer for 1 minute until light and fluffy. Sift in the powdered sugar
        and beat until fully incorporated. Add the vanilla and beat to combine.
        Add the cream, 1 tablespoon at a time, and beat to combine, until
        desired consistency is reached.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer the buttercream to a piping bag fitted with a round tip.</li>
      <li>
        Add a dollop of buttercream to one macaroon shell. Top it with another
        macaroon shell to create a sandwich. Repeat with remaining macaroon shells
        and buttercream.
      </li>
      <li>Place in an airtight container for 24 hours to “bloom”.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
